## Goals
- Properly research the chosen phenomenon that arises from social bots interacting with users and with each other in a media ecosystem.
- Complete all deliverables before their respective deadlines with high quality.
- Collaborate to achieve at least a B+ grade on this project.
- Leverage each member’s strengths to ensure deliverables are completed as efficiently as possible, with opportunities for everyone to learn new things.

 ## Ground Rules
*These define what group members expect from one another and what norms they agree on relating to behaviours and actions. Below are examples of the types of areas it is important to address and examples of what form they might take.*

| **Area**        | **Principles & Norms**<br>_All members of the group agree to:_  |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Communication** | - All members have decided to use Discord as the primary form of communication. <br> - Group members will respond to messages in a prompt manner. <br> - Email will serve as our secondary/backup method for communication. |
| **Meetings**      | - Be punctual. <br> - Google Docs will be used as our primary means of sharing documents. <br> - Discord will be our primary means for team meetings. <br> - Take note of assigned tasks for each member. |
| **Deadlines**     | - Complete assigned deliverables on time. <br> - If circumstances arise that prevent tasks from being done on time, communicate to the group early on. |

 
## Care Statement
*Outline here how the team will strive to care for the health of each other and the team as a whole during the project duration:*

- Work under the assumption that everyone is committed to the project and their tasks.
- If someone is unable to do their assigned task, encourage them to seek help/support rather than blame them.
- Work together to build an efficient and inclusive team dynamic.

### **Strategies for Realizing These Ideals**
- During meetings, do individual check-ups on each other’s work and give constructive feedback.
- Properly and fairly delegate the work to ensure that the group shares the workload.
 
## Group Roles
- Group members have agreed to split responsibilities as equally as possible for each deliverable to ensure everyone contributes fairly and the work distribution is balanced.

## Performance Agreement
*Considers how the group will address non-performance of what is agreed to. Whatever the group agrees upon should correspond to the impact or gravity of the issues at hand.*

- Any breaches to the terms agreed to in this document will result in a group meeting ironing out the problems that need to be resolved.
- If a member of the group is unable to meet their delegated obligation, notify the group as soon as possible.
- In extreme situations where a group member does not communicate with the group at all, contact the professor or a TA.
