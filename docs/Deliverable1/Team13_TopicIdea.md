Section 1: Phenomena of interest 
- An echo chamber is a phenomenon that occurs in a media ecosystem where individuals (humans) are exposed to content/information that reinforces their existing beliefs while deterring them away from any alternative viewpoints that contradict it.
- This phenomenon is especially prevalent on social media platforms such as Youtube where there are algorithms and social interactions that play a significant role in shaping what the user engages with.
- Social bots on Youtube amplify this effect by interacting with each other and with the recommendation algorithm to amplify content that aligns with the user’s interests/beliefs (reinforcement loops).
- These AI-to-AI interactions consist of working together to artificially inflate the popularity of a video on Youtube (through views, likes, comments, shares, etc), making it more likely for it to be recommended by the algorithm.
- This phenomenon can have serious implications like misinformation and political polarization. By studying this phenomenon through agent-based modelling, we can simulate how bot-driven amplification influences media ecosystems.
- Understanding how these bots shape digital discourse can help in designing better recommendation algorithms and developing strategies to counter selective exposure.
- Key dynamics: bot-driven content amplification, selective exposure, reinforcement loops.
